## Software Engineer | From 5G Networks to Financial Code

---

I'm a Software Engineer who believes the most rewarding paths are rarely straight lines. <br/>
My journey into code was a deliberate one, born from a passion for building things that led me from 3D design and network infrastructure to crafting robust backend solutions with Java and Spring Boot.

I made a life-changing pivot to software development‚Äîtrading a career in core network engineering for the craft of coding. It was a conscious decision to pursue what I love, even when it meant taking a significant pay cut and stepping away from a secure path during a volatile time (Birth of AI) in the tech industry. <br/>

This journey has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and an unwavering drive to build and learn every single day.

### üöÄ My Journey

* **The Creative Start:** My story began in the world of design, modeling and animating in Autodesk Maya. While I loved the craft, I sought a field with a more concrete future here in Uzbekistan, a decision that led me to my next chapter.
* **The Engineering Foundation:** After choosing to study Information Technology, I joined **Huawei** as a PS Core Engineer. There, I dove deep into the heart of telecommunications‚Äîmaintaining mobile operator networks, leading a DPI project, and helping build a Data Center and 5G Core network infrastructure from the ground up.
* **The Leap of Faith:** Despite my success in network engineering, my passion for coding persisted. I made the jump to **Tenge Bank** as a Software Engineer, embracing the Java ecosystem. This wasn't just a career change; it was a commitment to my passion, a choice I'm proud of every day.
* **Today:** I'm building and scaling financial applications at Tenge Bank, collaborating on innovative projects, and constantly looking for opportunities to become a better engineer than I was yesterday.
